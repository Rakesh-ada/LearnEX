It's not just a project—it's a step toward #EducationForAll 🌍

## 💻 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS ⚛️
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum-compatible networks (currently deployed on edu-chain) 🔗
- **Storage**: IPFS via Pinata 📂
- **Web3 Integration**: ethers.js 🌐

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 📋 Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+)
- npm or yarn
- MetaMask wallet
- Pinata account for IPFS storage

### ⚙️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Rakesh-ada/LearnEX.git
   cd study-marketplace
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env.local` file based on `.env.example`:

   ```
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```

4. Update the `.env.local` file with your contract address and Pinata API keys:

   ```
   # Contract Information
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xe12D1e1698d7E07206b5C6C49466631c4dDfbF1B
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID=656476  # edu-chain network ID

   # IPFS Configuration
   NEXT_PUBLIC_PINATA_API_KEY=your_pinata_api_key
   NEXT_PUBLIC_PINATA_API_SECRET=your_pinata_api_secret
   NEXT_PUBLIC_PINATA_JWT=your_pinata_jwt
   NEXT_PUBLIC_PLATFORM_FEE_PERCENT=2.5
   ```

### 🔄 Deployment to GitHub

If you plan to deploy this project to GitHub Pages or use GitHub Actions for CI/CD, follow these steps:

1. Go to your GitHub repository settings

2. Navigate to "Secrets and variables" > "Actions"

3. Add the following repository secrets:

   * `NEXT_PUBLIC_PINATA_API_KEY` - Your Pinata API key
   * `NEXT_PUBLIC_PINATA_API_SECRET` - Your Pinata API secret
   * `NEXT_PUBLIC_PINATA_JWT` - Your Pinata JWT token

4. (Optional) If you're using GitHub Pages, make sure to configure your workflow to set these environment variables during the build process:

   ```yaml
   env:
     NEXT_PUBLIC_PINATA_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.NEXT_PUBLIC_PINATA_API_KEY }}
     NEXT_PUBLIC_PINATA_API_SECRET: ${{ secrets.NEXT_PUBLIC_PINATA_API_SECRET }}
     NEXT_PUBLIC_PINATA_JWT: ${{ secrets.NEXT_PUBLIC_PINATA_JWT }}
     NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS: "0xe12D1e1698d7E07206b5C6C49466631c4dDfbF1B"
     NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID: "656476"
     NEXT_PUBLIC_PLATFORM_FEE_PERCENT: "2.5"
   ```

### 📝 Smart Contract Deployment

You have two options for deploying the smart contract:

#### Option 1: Use the Default Contract ✅

The contract is currently deployed at address `0xe12D1e1698d7E07206b5C6C49466631c4dDfbF1B` on the edu-chain network.

#### Option 2: Deploy Your Own Contract 🛠️

1. Navigate to the "Organization" tab in the application
2. Select the "Deployment Guide" tab
3. Follow the step-by-step instructions:

   * Prepare your contracts (StudyMarketplace.sol or SchoolLibrary.sol)
   * Open Remix IDE
   * Create & compile the smart contract
   * Deploy with MetaMask
   * Copy the contract address to use in the application
4. Watch the embedded video tutorial for detailed guidance
5. Get test ETH from the [EDU-Chain HackQuest Faucet](https://www.hackquest.io/faucets/656476) before deploying

After deployment, update the contract address in your `.env.local` file.
